#Twilight Imperium for Dummies

##how to win:
Get 10 victory points.

###Setup
Build the map, containing hex-tiles with planets, anomalies (like supernovas and gravity rifts), and wormholes, with _Mecatol Rex_ in the middle.
Everyone chooses a faction. Each one has their own good and bad points. Some are even more or less despised by players due to how they play. Choose wisely. 

###Strategy Phase
Everyone chooses 1 strategy card. This card gives you a special action and your turn order or initiative.

#####Leadership, initiative 1
You get a handful of command tokens, and everyone can spend planets for their influence to get more.

#####Diplomacy, initiative 2
You protect a system from being activated by any other player, and everyone may refresh two planets of their choosing

#####Politics, initiative 3
You get to pick who gets first pick at the next round of strategy tokens, and a peek at the next two agendas. Everyone draws action cards.

#####Construction, initiative 4
You get to build two structures, everyone else may build one and activate the system they build it in

#####Trade, initiative 5
You get money, and everyone gets tradeable funds

#####Warfare, initiative 6
You unactivate a system you have activated, everyone else gets to build ships

#####Technology, initiative 7
You get up to two technology, everyone else gets one

#####Imperial, initiative 8
You get to score a victory point if you hold _Mecatol Rex_, and you may also score a public objective. Everyone else draws a secret objective, including you if you didn't score a victory point with _Mecatol Rex_.

###Action Phase:
During this phase, everyone takes turns doing transactions and Actions.

####Actions:

#####Tactical Action:
Take a tactics token from your player sheet and put it on a hex tile. You then move, space battle, invade, ground battle, and build units out of spacedocks you own, in that order.

#####Strategic Action:
Use your Strategy card and do the thing listed above.

#####Component action:
Anything that says "ACTION" on it. Usually faction abilities, action cards, and a few other things.

###Status Phase:
Refresh all planets, repair any ships damaged from battle, draw action cards, and most importantly, **score objectives, winning you victory points**.

###Agenda phase:
If someone took control of _Mecatol Rex_, you go to agenda phase after status. The speaker draws and reads aloud an agenda, then everyone votes. You'll do this one more time.

###Game end
You continue the Strategy-action-status-agenda cycle until someone has 10 victory points, or 10 public objectives have been revealed.
